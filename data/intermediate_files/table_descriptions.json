Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company's assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company applied a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.

We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. We use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our investment portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with  $95\\%$  confidence interval.

    "Table Context": "Footnote: Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2025 relates to the acquisition of VIZIO Holding Corp. in December 2024 within the Walmart U.S. segment.\nText before the table in the filing: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill during fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.

Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2023, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of approximately  $8\\%$  each quarter over a three year period from the date of grant. For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of  $25\\%$  each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was  $2.0\\%$ ,  $2.2\\%$  and  $2.3\\%$ , respectively.  \n- Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest based on a one-year performance period followed by a two-year vesting period based on the passage of time. Vesting conditions during the performance period are based on achieving pre-established financial goals for metrics related to growth and returns and generally range from  $0\\%$  to  $150\\%$  of the original award amount. Vesting periods for restricted stock are generally between one month and three years. Vesting periods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or, in certain circumstances, deferred and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period if it is probable that performance conditions will be achieved. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was  $3.2\\%$ ,  $3.3\\%$  and  $3.3\\%$ , respectively.

The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.

The Sam's Club U.S. segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the profit or loss of its segments using operating income. The CODM uses operating income to allocate resources across the reportable segments as part of the Company's long-range and annual planning processes, and to evaluate planned versus actual results when assessing segment operating performance. From time to time, the Company may revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, and presentation of significant segment expenses, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.

    "Table Description": "Table Summary: The table details the valuation methodologies used by JPM Company for various products and instruments at fair value, along with their corresponding classifications within the fair value hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3). The table categorizes products/instruments, describes how they are valued, and indicates the level of the fair value hierarchy to which they are assigned.  Row 1: The first row describes “Securities financing agreements”, stating that valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider derivative features, market rates for the respective maturity, and collateral characteristics. These agreements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Row 2: The second row details “Loans and lending-related commitments – wholesale”, indicating that where observable market data is available, valuations are based on observed market prices, relevant broker quotes, and observed market prices for similar instruments. When observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS and credit rating. These are classified as Level 2 or 3.  Row 3: The third row focuses on “Loans – consumer – residential mortgage loans expected to be sold”, stating that fair value is based on observable market prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidity. These loans are predominantly classified as Level 2.  Row 4: The fourth row describes “Investment and trading securities”, stating that they are valued using quoted market prices. In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on observable market prices for similar securities, relevant broker quotes, and discounted cash flows. Additionally, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for mortgage- and asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. These securities are classified as Level 1, Level 2 or 3.  Row 5: The fifth row details “Physical commodities”, stating that they are valued using observable market prices or data and are predominantly classified as Level 1 or 2."

Transaction costs for the Firm's physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm's physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm's hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\nText before the table in the filing: JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. (b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of  $488 million, nonagency securities of$ 5 million and non-trading loans of $368 million.  (c) Comprises nonagency securities of $18 million, trading loans of $65 million and non-trading loans of $1.3 billion. (d) Comprises trading loans of  $1.0 billion and non-trading loans of$ 707 million. (e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. (f) Includes equity securities of  $734 million including$ 672 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. (h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price. (i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.\nText before the table in the filing: In the Firm's view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm's estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

    "Table Context": "Text before the table in the filing: Forward price – The forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.",

The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.

When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.",

    "Table Context": "Text before the table in the filing: CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm's existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm's credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm's FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm's positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm's credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary. The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities.

For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm's net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments.

It is the policy of JPMorganChase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables. While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties' favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm's and its subsidiaries' respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts.

Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes. Other purchased protection also includes credit protection against certain loans in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of  $49 million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of$  (1.2) billion at December 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $103 million at December 31, 2024. (c) Substantially all of the Firm's U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity.

Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorganChase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.

    "Table Context": "Text before the table in the filing: At December 31, 2024, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm's ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm's collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.

Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorganChase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as much as approximately $2.4 billion. The change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result in a payment or income statement recognition.

(Table continued from previous page) The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 322-325 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets).

Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.
